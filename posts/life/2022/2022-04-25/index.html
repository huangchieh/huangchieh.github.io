I hope I can make it this time.\nOne of the teachers at Wenzhou University, Mr. Wang asks me whether I am enrolled as a Ph.D. student. I say no, and tell him my situation. He says Macau is a good place to study and live, as his wife has been there for a year. And she likes it there very much.\nThen I practice typing for about an hour. I’d like to say, I have made big progress. I can type without looking at the keyboard anymore. This feeling is so satisfying. I hope someday I can type as the Japanese YouTuber Devaslife. His video is so satisfying.\nMy brother Gang has finished his Ph.D. Recently, he has written a manuscript, which is about the water-air interface. He designs a method to determine the thickness of the interface. I like this work too. So I encourage him to try to submit it to the PNAS just like he did before. I help him to convert this manuscript into the PNAS version, which seems elegant.\nIn the evening, Mr. Liang Xi, my classmate, messages me and tells me that he is going to prepare for a Ph.D. as he has a lot of time as his job is not that busy. I am so glad he shares life thinking with me. He is a good friend.\nWriting in English is not that difficult. I can express what I am thinking.
